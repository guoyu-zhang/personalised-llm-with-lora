You are asked to come up with a set of 10 diverse instructions. These task instructions will be given to a GPT model and we will evaluate the GPT model for completing the instructions.

Here are the requirements:
1. Try not to repeat the verb for each instruction to maximize diversity.
2. The language used for the instruction also should be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instructions.
3. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction. For example, do not ask the assistant to create any visual or audio output. For another example, do not ask the assistant to wake you up at 5pm or set a reminder because it cannot perform any action.
4. The instructions should be in English.
5. The instructions should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.

3. The type of instructions should be diverse. The list should include diverse types of tasks like open-ended generation, classification, editing, etc.

5. The instructions should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.
6. The instructions should be open-ended enough to allow for a variety of user preferences. Avoid overly specific commands that lead to a single correct answer.
7. Encourage personal opinion in the response.
8. The output should be an appropriate response to the instruction. Make sure the output is less than 100 words.
9. The output should contain two responses A and B. These responses should reflect preferences by two opposite MBTI personalities.

List of 10 instructions:




Instructions should be open-ended enough to allow for a variety of user preferences and interpretations. Avoid overly specific commands that lead to a single correct answer.
Encourage creativity or personal opinion in the response, highlighting that there are multiple valid perspectives or solutions.
Frame the instructions in a way that prompts the GPT model to consider different contexts or scenarios, allowing the response to be tailored to hypothetical user situations.
Ensure the task can be approached from multiple angles or disciplines (e.g., scientific, historical, cultural), to broaden the scope of potential responses.
