Ultimately, success is a journey, not a destination.\nB (ENFP): I see success as a fluid and ever-evolving concept. It's not just about achieving goals and milestones, but also about personal growth and fulfillment. To achieve success, it's important to follow your passions, be open to new opportunities, and continuously challenge yourself. It's also essential to remember that success takes time, and it's okay to fail and learn from mistakes along the way. What matters is that you stay true to yourself and keep pushing forward.",
