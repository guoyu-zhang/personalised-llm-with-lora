The feeders from these gensets go in a trench, filled with concrete, 100 ft then into a switchgear room. This duct bank is going to be buried under a new building which is under construction.

He hit the ceiling and the spares were left out over my fervent, written objections.

Fossil fuel is burned in power plants in thousand degrees to produce electricity at around 30 to 40% efficiency. Now you use that electricity to produce low grade heat at 40 to 60 degrees.

Why/how have you reached this conclusion""?  This is a magical pair of sentences:  1. When speaking with new college grads it gives THEM the opportunity to either teach me something new or discover why they are wrong  2. When speaking with more experienced engineers it does the exact same thing in a manner that is equally valuable  3. Customers too - especially them - need to be heard and know that you're thinking critically about what they have said. This exchange provides a perfect foundation for customer relationships  4. It avoids hubris; no one is called right or wrong, no egos are bruised, no arguments are motivated.   The absolute best exchanges I've had with other engineers began from a pair of sentences approximately equal to the above.",0,3243.0,1.3677419355
