The feeders from these gensets go in a trench, filled with concrete, 100 ft then into a switchgear room. This duct bank is going to be buried under a new building which is under construction.

He hit the ceiling and the spares were left out over my fervent, written objections.

Fossil fuel is burned in power plants in thousand degrees to produce electricity at around 30 to 40% efficiency. Now you use that electricity to produce low grade heat at 40 to 60 degrees.

Why/how have you reached this conclusion""?  This is a magical pair of sentences:  1. When speaking with new college grads it gives THEM the opportunity to either teach me something new or discover why they are wrong  2. When speaking with more experienced engineers it does the exact same thing in a manner that is equally valuable  3. Customers too - especially them - need to be heard and know that you're thinking critically about what they have said. This exchange provides a perfect foundation for customer relationships  4. It avoids hubris; no one is called right or wrong, no egos are bruised, no arguments are motivated.   The absolute best exchanges I've had with other engineers began from a pair of sentences approximately equal to the above.",0,3243.0,1.3677419355

These diverters existed closer to cities (think the point of entry).  There are also historical accounts of two major failures that were cured by the installation of temporary lead pipes.     Not to minimize your question, but much of the aqueduct system is at grade or underground, so repairs weren't commonly necessary, it was more important to clean calcium deposits or algae.  The overhead portions collapsed on a handful or historic occasions due to earthquakes, but this wasn't common.     If a diverter or lead piping wasn't available, it would be easy enough to physically block up the aqueduct and allow the water to overflow.

A 747 needs about 2 miles to take off, and 1 mile to land.   This of course does not account for catapults (take off) and arresting cables (landing) but a standard 747 couldn't use those without some reengineering.",1,7680.0,1.2371134021

Given the current public health situation, my exercise options are limited and to compensate I've started taking the stairs to and from my 21st floor apartment. Today as I climbed, heartrate up and breath heavy, I noticed that there didn't seem to be any fans or ducts at any of the landings - all the walls and stairs were solid concrete.   In general, how fresh (i.e. oxygen content relative to outside air) is the air in stairwells, and where does it come from?",flbrxi8,flbtcua,1585011233,1585012155,16,22,"On older buildings of the size you’re describing: no specific ventilation system for stairwells  On newer buildings of the size you’re describing: a fan moves air around to create a similar air pressure at each floor to make opening doors easy/similar. Sometimes there’s a heater, air conditioner, or heat pump every few floors, depending on owner requirements.","Balancer here. In my experience there is not typically specific fresh air for stairwells (mini-split is ductless and provides no outside air). There is outside air/make-up to occupied areas, though. That creates a small positive pressure, some of which makes its way to the stairs. That along with any stack-effect usually is enough for the stairs.   That is separate from any smoke evacuation fans that you will have on medium and tall buildings.",0,922.0,1.375

I understand the principles of induced demand and the idea that more people will utilize an open roadway, but it seems like if that were completely the case, then we should be able to eliminate lanes without adverse effect as well. In essence, every highway should be one lane. Given that we have multiple lane highways across the country, how does it stand to reason that adding additional lanes wouldn't achieve higher throughput, and eventually, reduced traffic?",dwi0dl3,dwhzthk,1522362031,1522361478,23,20,"The system of roads, traffic lights, and on ramps to get me to work each day is like a gravity pipe system IMO.
