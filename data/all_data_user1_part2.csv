Not to minimize your question, but much of the aqueduct system is at grade or underground, so repairs weren't commonly necessary, it was more important to clean calcium deposits or algae.  The overhead portions collapsed on a handful or historic occasions due to earthquakes, but this wasn't common.

Early cad monkey stuff. I was composing an incoming order to cut some quarter inch plate rectangles, but forgot to double check the final cleaned-up DXF to the drawing. Sheet scaling would sneak in and make the parts too big or small, but usually gets caught when the parts get nested. This is why it's important to have the DXF for accurate CAD, and a PDF so the extents and intent are known.  Parts shipped were twice the size, about 4"" x 8"" instead of 2"" x 4"", and there were only like 100 in the box. The larger parts were eventually used up as welding shims or feet or gussets - whatever a fab shop might need and could just grab and use.",1,6026.0,1.0769230769
