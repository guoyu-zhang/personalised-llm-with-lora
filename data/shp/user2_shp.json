This is because heating the oil along with the pan in some cases can expose the oil to enough heat, for a long enough duration, to start the process of polymerization. The longer you heat the oil, the more thick and gummy the oil will become. Even very slight polymerization can ruin your chances of avoiding eggs or delicate fish sticking to your pan.  If utilizing the oil\u2019s anti-sticking properties is not of concern, such as when you\u2019re using a non stick coated pan, it\u2019s arguably more beneficial to heat the oil with the pan for a few reasons. For one, the oil will help to displace some of the heat from your pan to help prevent warping and preserve the quality of the non stick coating for longer.   Hope this helps :)",

The overhead portions collapsed on a handful or historic occasions due to earthquakes, but this wasn't common.

I think Mjolnir is basically a tier 2 weapon, which is nothing to sneeze at. I would put it along with (also in no particular order): All Black the Necro-Sword, the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak, the Silver Surfer's board (is that a weapon?), the Eye of Agamotto, Dr. Doom's Armor, and possibly Iron Man's God Buster Armor.   If paired with the belt of strength, Mjolnir *might* be able to hit top 10, since it did chip a Celestial's armor, but even then that was with a God-blast which destroyed Mjolnir in the process.",

EDIT: Hmm, I guess it\u2019s not that far before the wavelength of light. And you can of course just pump more light in.

That means under typical situations you only have access to 65% of max oxygen pool in your blood.

Because of this property, complex numbers are useful when calculating two properties that are mathematically related, but cannot be substituted for one another - like electricity and magnetism. You can have 5 electricity and 3 magnetism from a wire (which could be represented as 5+3i), but saying you have 8 electromagnetism is invalid. You could also just write the maths with electricity and magnetism as separate numbers, but it hides the fact that when one changes so does the other.",
